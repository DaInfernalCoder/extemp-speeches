This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an extemporaneous speeches leaderboard application built with Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, and Supabase. The app displays a competitive leaderboard showing speakers' rankings with both weekly and all-time speech counts. Users can log in with Google OAuth and submit their speech recordings by uploading videos directly to Cloudflare Stream or by uploading audio files to Supabase storage.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server (runs on http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run ESLint
npm run lint
```

## Architecture

### Next.js App Router (v16)

This project uses Next.js 16's App Router architecture:
- **app/layout.tsx**: Root layout defining global structure, fonts (Geist Sans/Mono), and metadata
- **app/page.tsx**: Home page that renders the LeaderBoard component
- **app/components/**: React components (currently contains LeaderBoard.tsx)
- **app/globals.css**: Global styles using Tailwind CSS v4 syntax

### Tailwind CSS v4

This project uses **Tailwind CSS v4**, which has different syntax than v3:
- Uses `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of separate directives
- Uses `@theme inline` for custom theme configuration
- Configured through [postcss.config.mjs](postcss.config.mjs) with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin

### Neobrutalist Design System

The application uses a **neobrutalist design language** inspired by modern design trends. Key characteristics:

**Color Palette** ([app/globals.css](app/globals.css)):
- Background: Warm cream (`#FFF8F0`)
- Foreground: Dark charcoal (`#1a1a1a`)
- Border: Pure black (`#000000`)
- Primary accent: Vibrant blue (`#0066FF`)
- Secondary accent: Bright yellow (`#FFD233`)
- Additional accents: Pink (`#FF6B9D`), Teal (`#00CDB8`), Purple (`#B794F6`)
- Status colors: Success green (`#00D9A0`), Error red (`#FF4757`)

**Design Elements**:
- **Thick black borders**: 3-4px solid black borders on all interactive elements
- **Hard shadows**: Offset box shadows (e.g., `4px 4px 0px #000`) with no blur
- **Flat colors**: Solid color fills, no gradients (except on podium for visual hierarchy)
- **Bold typography**: Heavy font weights (700-800) for headings, medium (400-500) for body text
- **Rounded corners**: Subtle border radius (8-12px) - not completely square
- **High contrast**: Strong visual separation between elements

**Utility Classes** ([app/globals.css](app/globals.css)):
- `.brutal-border`: 3px solid black border
- `.brutal-border-thick`: 4px solid black border
- `.brutal-shadow`: Standard hard shadow (4px 4px 0px #000)
- `.brutal-shadow-lg`: Large hard shadow (6px 6px 0px #000)
- `.brutal-shadow-hover`: Hover state shadow (2px 2px 0px #000)
- `.brutal-card`: Pre-styled card with border, shadow, and rounded corners
- `.brutal-button`: Interactive button with border, shadow, and hover effects

**Component Styling Patterns**:
- **Buttons**: Thick borders, hard shadows that shift on hover (shadow translates down/right on press)
- **Modals**: Cards with `brutal-card` class, thick borders, and prominent shadows
- **Forms**: Inputs with 3px black borders, white backgrounds, no focus rings (use thick black outline instead)
- **Tables**: Grid lines with 3px black borders between cells and rows
- **Progress bars**: White backgrounds with thick borders, colored fills
- **Links**: Bold text with primary color, underline on hover
- **Sliders**: Custom styled with square/rounded thumbs, thick borders, and hard shadows

**Interaction Design**:
- Hover states shift shadows from `4px 4px` to `2px 2px` with transform
- Active states shift shadows to `1px 1px` with larger transform
- Transitions are snappy (150ms) for immediate feedback
- No opacity changes - use shadow/transform instead

### TypeScript Configuration

- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to the root directory (e.g., `@/app/components/Foo`)
- **Strict mode enabled**: All code must pass strict TypeScript checks
- **Target**: ES2017
- **JSX**: Uses react-jsx transform

### Supabase Backend

The application uses **Supabase** for authentication, data storage, and file storage:
- **Database Tables**:
  - `users`: Stores user profiles (synced with auth.users), includes `email_reminders_enabled` and `last_reminder_sent_at` fields
  - `speeches`: Stores speech submissions with speech URLs and week tracking
  - `ballots`: Stores speech reviews with multiple criteria ratings (1-10 scale), feedback text, and comparison flags
  - `feature_requests`: Stores user-submitted feature requests with title and description
- **Storage Buckets**:
  - `speech-audio`: Stores uploaded audio files (public read, authenticated write, 50 MB limit)
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth via Supabase Auth (no provider-specific scopes required - used for authentication only)
- **Real-time**: Leaderboard and ballots update live when speeches or ballots are submitted
- **RLS (Row Level Security)**: Enabled on all tables and storage buckets for security

Configuration:
- Supabase client utilities in [lib/supabase/](lib/supabase/)
- Environment variables in `.env.local` (not committed)
- Middleware for auth session refresh in [middleware.ts](middleware.ts)

### Email Notifications

The application uses **Resend** for email delivery:
- **Email Service**: Resend API for sending transactional and reminder emails
- **Email Templates**: Located in [lib/resend.ts](lib/resend.ts) with functions for:
  - `sendDailyReminderEmail()`: Daily reminder for users who haven't submitted a speech
  - `sendBallotNotificationEmail()`: Notification when a user receives feedback on their speech
  - `sendSpeechSubmissionAlert()`: Alert to coaches when a new speech is submitted
  - `sendFeatureRequestAlert()`: Alert for new feature requests
- **Scheduled Emails**: Daily reminders are triggered via Supabase pg_cron job calling the `/api/emails/daily-reminder` endpoint
- **Configuration**:
  - Requires `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable
  - From address: `yourextempcoaches@resend.dev`
  - Email links base URL resolution order:
    1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (recommended to set to `https://extemp-speeches.vercel.app/` in production)
    2. `VERCEL_URL` (auto-provided by Vercel, prefixed with `https://`)
    3. Fallback to `http://localhost:3000` for local development
  - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in Vercel Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables for Production (and Preview if desired)
